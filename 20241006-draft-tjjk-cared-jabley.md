--- abstract

Some encrypted DNS clients require anonymity from their encrypted
DNS servers to prevent third parties from correlating client DNS
queries with other data for surveillance or data mining purposes.
However, there are cases where the client and server have a
pre-existing relationship and each wants to prove its identity to
the other.  For example, an encrypted DNS server may only wish to
accept queries from encrypted DNS clients that are managed by the
same enterprise, and an encrypted DNS client may need to confirm
the identity of the encrypted DNS server it is communicating with.
This requires mutual authentication.

This document discusses the circumstances under which client
authentication is appropriate to use with encrypted DNS, the benefits
and limitations of doing so, and recommends authentication mechanisms
to be used when communicating with TLS-based encrypted DNS protocols.

# Introduction

There are times when a client needs to authenticate itself before
it can be authorised to use a DNS server. One example is when an
encrypted DNS server only accepts connections from pre-approved
clients, such as an encrypted DNS service provided by an enterprise
for its remote employees.  Encrypted DNS clients trying to connect
to such a server might experience refused connections if they did
not provide authentication that allows the enterprise's server to
authorise its use.

This is different from general use of encrypted DNS by anonymous
clients to public DNS resolvers, where it is bad practice for the
client to provide any kind of identifying information to the server.
For example, Section 8.2 of {{?RFC8484}} discourages use of HTTP
cookies with DNS over HTTP (DoH). This ensures that clients provide
a minimal amount of identifiable or correlatable information to
servers that do not need to know anything about the client in order
to provide name resolution.

Because of the significant difference in these scenarios, it is
important to define the situations in which interoperable encrypted
DNS clients can use client authentication without compromising the
privacy provided by encrypted DNS in the first place. Even then,
it is important to recognize what value client authentication
provides to encrypted DNS clients versus encrypted DNS servers in
the context of both connection management and DNS resolution utility.
This document discusses these topics and recommends best practice
for authentication.

# Conventions and Definitions

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

# Terminology

Encrypted DNS server: a recursive DNS resolver that implements one
or more encrypted DNS protocols, such as those defined in {{!RFC9499}}
(DNS-over-TLS, DNS-over-HTTPS, DNS-over-QUIC).

Protective DNS server: a policy-implementing, recursive DNS resolver
service that filters DNS queries to prevent resolution for known
malicious domains and/or IP addresses. Protective DNS servers support
DNS technologies including encrypted DNS protocol support (DoH/DoT)
and IPv6 resolution.

Other terminology related to the DNS is used in this document as
defined in {{!RFC9499}}.

# Benefits of client authentication with encrypted DNS

Strong identification of encrypted DNS clients by the encrypted DNS
server allows the DNS server to apply client-specific resolution
policies in a securely-verifiable way. Today, a common practice is
to establish client-specific resolution policies that are applied
on behalf of particular clients based on their observed IP address.
This is not only an insecure method that cannot account for clients
sending requests through middleboxes, but it can only be used when
expected IP addresses are known in advance. This is not practical
for enterprises with remote employees without introducing a dependency
on tunneling DNS traffic to a managed gateway or proxy whose IP
address is known. This in turn forces enterprises to choose between
running proxy or gateway infrastructure per client (or at least
per-client IP address mappings) or losing client identification.

Strong identification of encrypted DNS clients by the encrypted DNS
server also brings identification up to the application layer, which
insulates the mechanism used for identity management from network
topology changes and allows the sense of client identity in the
server to persist despite client IP address changes.

# Drawbacks of client authentication with encrypted DNS

While there are benefits in using client authentication with encrypted
DNS in limited circumstances, authentication has drawbacks that
make it inappropriate in many other cases. For example, client
authentication is generally considered to be bad practice in uses
of encrypted DNS that are motivated by client anonyminity, since
it allows a full history of resolution requests to be associated
confidently with the identity of an individual client. This is
unacceptable practice.

Public DNS servers generally implement allow- and blocklists at the
IP layer as part of a layered defence against abuse; IP-layer access
control allows unwanted traffic to be discarded early and helps
mitigate unwanted server load. Public encrypted DNS servers with
the additional requirement to permit authenticated clients makes
it impossible to drop unwanted traffic early based on source IP
address, which increases the cost of mitigation and adds complexity
that may well introduce additional attack vectors.

# When to use client authentication with encrypted DNS

Encrypted DNS servers that provide resolution using transport
protocols that incorporate TLS or dTLS such as DoH {{?RFC8484}},
DoT {{?RFC7858}}, and DoQ {{?RFC9250}} SHOULD NOT provide client
authentication except in the limited situations described in this
section.

Encrypted DNS servers that use other transport protocols are not
in scope for this document.

## When servers should require client authentication

Encrypted DNS servers MUST NOT challenge clients for authentication
unless they need to restrict connections to a set of clients they
have a pre-existing relationship with as defined in {restrict-clients},
regardless of whether or not the requirements in {per-client}
apply.  Encrypted DNS servers that meet the requirements in
{restrict-clients} MAY challenge clients to authenticate to avoid
achieving the same goal of identifying clients through other, less
secure means (such as IP address or data in the DNS query payload).

### Restricting connections to allowed clients {#restrict-clients}

An encrypted DNS server that provides resolution to a specific set
of clients and refuses service to all other clients MAY require
clients to authenticate.

For example, an encrypted DNS server owned by an enterprise that
only allows connections from devices managed by that same enterprise
might require clients to authenticate.

### Resolving names differently per client {#per-client}

An encrypted DNS server that provides client-specific resolution
behaviour MAY require clients to authenticate in circumstances
where the appropriate policy for particular clients is
specified by the operator of the encrypted DNS server.

For example, an encrypted DNS server that is configured to allow
some clients to resolve certain names while other clients are not
allowed needs to identify the client so that the resolution behaviour
for those names can be implemented accurately.

Encrypted DNS servers SHOULD NOT attempt to authenticate clients
to identify the appropriate resolution policy to use when the
difference in resolution behavior between them is not imposed by
the operator of the server but instead is chosen by the client.

For example, some public encrypted DNS services provide clients
with the option of blocking resolution requests for particular
categories of domain names, such as names associated with malware
distribution, adult content or advertisers, and makes servers with
particular resolution policies available on different IP addresses.
A client who wishes to opt-in to a server with a particular resolution
policy can do so by sending queries to the corresponding IP address,
and no client identification is required.

## When clients should attempt to authenticate

An encrypted DNS client MUST NOT offer authentication to any encrypted
DNS server unless it was specifically configured to expect that
server to require authentication, independent of the mechanism by
which the client chose or discovered the encrypted DNS server to
use.

An encrypted DNS client MUST NOT offer authentication when the
server connection was established using DDR {{?RFC9462}}, even if
the IP address of the original DNS server was specifically configured
for the encrypted DNS client as one that might require authentication.
This is because in that circumstance there is not a pre-existing
relationship with the encrypted DNS server (or else DDR bootstrapping
into encrypted DNS would not have been necessary).

TBD: what to do with EDSR destinations {{EDSR-REDIRECTION}}

An encrypted DNS client MAY choose to present authentication to a
server that requests it, but is not required to do so; for example,
a client MAY choose instead not to use the server. If a client does
present an identity to a server, the identity SHOULD be unique to
that server, to reduce the risk of a client's resolution history
on multiple colluding servers being correlated.

# Recommendations

The following requirements were considered when formulating the
recommended authentication mechanism for encrypted DNS clients.
The authentication mechanism:

1. SHOULD be per-connection, not per-query, e.g. to
avoid unnecessary payload overheads
2. SHOULD use open, standard mechanisms where
possible, e.g. to avoid vendor lock-in and specialized cryptography
3. SHOULD be reusable across multiple encrypted DNS protocols, e.g.
to avoid protocol preference
4. SHOULD NOT require human user interaction to complete authentication

This document concludes that the best mechanism for encrypted
DNS client authentication is mTLS {{?RFC8705}} for the following
reasons:

1. mTLS identifies and authenticates clients, not users, per-connection
2. mTLS is an existing standard and is often readily available for TLS clients
3. X.509 certificates used for TLS client authentication allow a server to
include other attributes in an authentication decision, such as the client's
organization via PKI heiracrchy
4. mTLS is reusable across multiple encrypted DNS protocols
5. mTLS allows session resumption {{?RFC8446}}
6. mTLS does not require user interaction or apaplication layer input
for authentication

Encrypted DNS clients and servers that support offering or requesting
client authentication MUST support at least the use of mTLS in
addition to whatever other mechanism they wish to support.

Encrypted DNS clients and servers SHOULD prefer long-lived connections
when using client authentication to minimize the cost over time of
doing repeated TLS handshakes and identity verification.

## Why these requirements were chosen

### Per-connection scope

Any data added to each DNS message will have greater bandwidth and
processing costs than presenting authentication once per connection.
This is especially true in this case because the drawback of having
long-running encrypted DNS connections is the decreased privacy
through increased volume of directly correlatable queries. However,
this privacy threat does not apply to this situation because the
client's queries can already be correlated by the identity it
presents.  Therefore, per-connection bandwidth and data processing
overhead is expected to be much lower than per-query because there
is no incentive for clients and servers to not have long-running
encrypted DNS connections.

This is not expected to create excessive cost for server operators
because supporting encrypted DNS without client authentication
already requires per-connection state management.

### Reusable open standards

Reusing open standards ensures wide interoperability between vendors
that choose to implement client authentication in their encrypted
DNS stacks.

### Reusable across protocols

If a client authentication method for encrypted DNS were defined
or recommended that would only be usable by some TLS-encrypted DNS
protocols, it would encourage the development of a second or even
third solution later.

### Does not require human interaction

Humans using devices that use encrypted DNS, when given any kind
of prompt or login relating to establishing encrypted DNS connectivity,
are unlikely to understand what is happening and why. This will
inevitably lead to click-through behavior. Because the scope of
scenarios where client authentication for encrypted DNS is limited
to pre-existing relationships between the client and server, there
should be no need for at-run-time intervention by a human user.

## Why alternatives are not recommended

### Web tokens

OAuth or JSON web tokens alone require HTTP to validate, so would
not be a solution for encrypted DNS protocols other than DoH.  Web
access tokens can be used as certificate-bound access tokens in
combination with mTLS if they are needed to prove identity with
another authorization server, as described in {{?RFC8705}}.

### HTTP authentication

HTTP authentication as defined in {{?RFC9110}} provides a basic
authentication scheme for the HTTP protocol. Unless it is used with
TLS, i.e. over HTTPS, the credentials are encoded but not encrypted
which is insecure. As TLS is already used by the encrypted DNS
protocols in this document's scope, it is simpler to handle client
authentication and authorization at the TLS layer.  Additionally,
mTLS is more broadly-adopted than HTTP authentication. HTTP
authentication would only be a viable option for DoH, and not
extensible to other encrypted DNS solutions.

### FIDO

Web Authentication (WebAuthN) and the FIDO2 Client to Authenticator
Protocol (CTAP) use CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE),
described in {{?RFC8812}}. FIDO and WebAuthN are passkey solutions
designed to replace passwords for user authentication for online
services, and they are not typically used for general client
authentication. Passkeys are unique for each online service and
require user input for registration, and would require DNS servers
to support the WebAuthN protocol. Additionally, each sign-in requires
user input for local verification, using biometric, local PIN, or
a FIDO security key.

### Designing a novel solution

Designing a novel solution is never recommended when there is an
existing standard that meets the requirements.  Doing so would make
the encrypted DNS solution more difficult and time-consuming to
adopt, and most likely would introduce vendor lock-in.

# Operational Considerations

## Avoiding connectivity deadlocks

Deployers should carefully consider how they will handle certificate
rollover and revocation. If an encrypted DNS server only allows
connections from clients with valid certificates, and the client
is configured to only use the encrypted DNS server, then there will
be a deadlock when the certificate expires or is revoked such that
the client device will not have the connectivity needed to renew
or replace its certificate.

Encrypted DNS servers that challenge clients for authentication
SHOULD have a separate resolution policy for clients that do not
have valid credentials that allows them to resolve the subset of
names needed to connect to the infrastructure needed to acquire
certificates.

Alternatively, encrypted DNS clients that are configured to use
encrypted DNS servers that will require authentication MAY consider
configuring knowledge of certificate issuing infrastructure in
advance so that the DNS deadlock can be avoided without introducing
less secure DNS servers to their configuration (i.e.  hard coding
IP addresses and host names for certificate checking).

# Security Considerations

This document describes when and how encrypted DNS clients can
authenticate themselves to an encrypted DNS server. It does not
introduce any new security considerations beyond those of TLS and
mTLS. This document does not define recommendations for when and
how to use encrypted DNS client authentication for encrypted DNS
protocols that are based on TLS or dTLS.
